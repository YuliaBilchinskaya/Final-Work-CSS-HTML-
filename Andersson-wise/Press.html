      <p><em>"Art galleries, luxury hotels, and exotic restaurants are breathing new life into these former industrial spaces -- Austin’s indoor-outdoor marketplace, St. Elmo Public Market, will open in spring 2019 in a former school bus factory from the 1950s. The market features a large open space where school buses were once painted and repaired. Arthur Andersson of the building’s architecture firm, Andersson-Wise Architects, says, "In a city with few industrial neighborhoods left intact…the building’s character, masonry brick walls, exposed structural steel, and continuous clerestory windows have been preserved to create an environment steeped in the traditions of the warehouse and factory structures found in the neighborhood.” With a public market serving local fare, a creative office space, apartments, and a boutique hotel, the 12.5-acre site aims to be a curated gastronomic destination for locals and international foodies."</em></p>

Designed by Austin, Texas–based studio Andersson-Wise Architects, the 12,500-square-foot Stone Creek Camp is sited on a sloping hill whose topography guides visitors to discover the grounds slowly: from the gatehouse to the master house, main lodge, and guesthouse. The eco-friendly family retreat features a stacked wood facade that was built from fallen trees found on the site; a sod green roof that provides insulation; and stone, wood, windows, doors, and other construction materials sourced regionally."</em></p>

Frickenschmidt, thinking about the built environment is part of the larger project of consciously forming the congregation’s worship through a “return to sources.” Seeing the world sacramentally leads to a focus on the arrangement and interrelation of places, objects, and bodies as signs. Visitors to the interim sanctuary have been surprised by the intentionality and thoughtfulness of the integration of beautiful structure with beautiful structure."</em></p>

      <p><em>“I’ve noticed that buildings in Austin that were built before air-conditioning tend to be remarkable things,” he says. “People were very creative back then to make a space comfortable, so instead of installing a standard ducted-forced air system, we’re including individual A/C units and large fans to circulate the air. We’re also building deep canopies on the east and west sides of the building to help block out the sun at certain times of the day. You get an organic effect that seems natural and connected to the local climate and nature.” - Arthur Andersson, FAIA</em></p>

The concept behind our renovation is to save the best of what exists and pair it with the best of what’s current in terms of architecture, design and appealing amenities.” “When all is said and done, we will have created something that respects the original design … while providing downtown with a new structure with timeless appeal,” Andersson-Wise principal Arthur Andersson said.</em></p>

This is contrasted by deliberate moves to connect to the outdoors. The physical spaces open to showcase expansive views of Montana’s infinite sky and dramatic landscape. Each bedroom’s separate, screened-in space makes it possible to sleep in nature and yet be secure within the building. The wood and stone comprising the façade are each carried through to the interior of the project, further reinforcing the connection to the outdoors. Like the lake, the building feels as if it has been—and will be—there forever."</em></p>
